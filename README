PREREQUISITE:
Before you build our Traceroute application, check that you've installed last java 1.8 version,
and that it's set as the default java version.

You will also need to have GraphViz installed on you computer, especially its Dot component.

BUILDING:
you need to have Apache Ant installed in order to build the project.

To build the application, just execute ant in the folder NetGraph/build , where the ant script build.xml is located.


RUNNING
Once builded, you can run the jar file generated in NetGraph/build/dist/NetGraph.jar.
If you want to be able to use the fakeroute function, which emulate a fake traceroute,
you need to make sure the jar file 'fakeroute.jar' is located in the same folder as NetGraph.jar.
